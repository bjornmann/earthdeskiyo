Pull a nice picture of the planet and slap your company logo on it! The corporate dream!
For use with [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/).

## What now?

    This assumes the project is checked out into `~/github/earthdeskiyo` adjust as needed here and there and everywhere

First: to populate the photoData.json file used to select a desktop run the following command:

```

Then copy the contents of init.lua into your Hammerspoon config.

Update logo.png to be the logo you want to show in the top left corner.
